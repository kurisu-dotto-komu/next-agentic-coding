## FEATURE:

Mutliplayer tamagochi game.

There'a a tamagochi that has a lifecycle and moves around the screen which is fixed width of 100px by 100px matrix (scaled to fill the screen up to 1024px).

The tamagochi has a hunger level, a happiness level, and a health level.

Users can interact with the tamagochi by clicking on it.

There is no login and anyone can play at any time.

The tamagochi will move around the screen randomly.

The tamagochi will eat food when it is hungry.

The tamagochi will play with the user when it is happy.

IF nobody plays with the tamagochi for a while, it will die.

The tamagochi will die if it is not fed.

The tamagochi will die if it is not played with.

The tamagochi will die if it is not healthy.

You must come up with some fun interactions for the tamagochi and easter eggs.

The tamagochi should be randomly generated with a unique character, and use pixel art style. Both should be handled by the codebase, not external libraries.

## EXAMPLES:

No specific examples, just follow existing codebase for patterns.

## DOCUMENTATION:

N/A - research as needed.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

See the existing codebase for patterns, but remove the existing TODO logic and replace it with the tamagochi logic.
