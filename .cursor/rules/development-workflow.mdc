# Development Workflow Standards

## Git Operations

- **NEVER make git commands** unless explicitly instructed
- This includes:
  - `git add`
  - `git commit`
  - `git push`
  - `git pull`
  - Any other git operations

## Documentation Creation

- **NEVER proactively create documentation files** (*.md)
- Only create documentation when explicitly requested
- This includes:
  - README files
  - API documentation
  - Architecture documents
  - Any markdown files

## Testing and Linting Commands

- **NEVER call tools directly with `npx`**
- Always use npm scripts defined in package.json
- Forbidden: `npx playwright`, `npx eslint`
- Correct: `npm run test`, `npm run lint`

## Playwright Testing

- **NEVER use `--headed` or `--debug` flags**
- Always run tests in headless mode (default)
- Using headed mode causes problems in the environment

## Development Commands

### Frequent Use
- `npm run fix` - Run frequently to spot and fix issues early
- `npm run screenshots` - Generate screenshots for visual verification

### Occasional Use
- `npm run test` - Use sparingly as it's expensive
- `npm run test:build` - Use at the end of major work to verify build

### Visual Testing
- Create scenarios in `screenshots.spec.ts` for visual checks
- Use the playwright MCP server for interactive testing

## External Tools

- **Use `context7` MCP tool** when struggling with unfamiliar libraries
- This provides up-to-date documentation and examples

## Development Server

- **Dev server runs in background** - no need to start it
- Focus on implementation rather than server management
