# Project Structure and Organization

## Route Organization

- **Main routes location**: `./app/(routes)` folder
- This organizational pattern keeps routes clearly separated
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions

## Directory Structure Guidelines

- Keep related files close together
- Use clear, descriptive folder names
- Follow established project patterns
- Group by feature rather than file type when appropriate

## File Naming Conventions

- Use consistent casing (follow existing patterns in the project)
- Component files: PascalCase (e.g., `Button.tsx`)
- Utility files: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- Test files: match the file they test with `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts`

## Module Organization Best Practices

- Co-locate related code
- Keep test files next to the code they test
- Separate concerns into appropriate directories:
  - Components for UI elements
  - Hooks for custom React hooks
  - Utils for utility functions
  - Types for TypeScript type definitions
  - Services for API or external service integrations
