## FEATURE:

Build a collaborative real-time coffee drinking game that combines social interaction with engaging gameplay mechanics. Players will create unique coffee-loving characters using a character generation library, then join shared virtual coffee shops where they can participate in coffee-themed mini-games, challenges, and collaborative brewing sessions. The game will feature a progression system where players unlock new coffee recipes, brewing techniques, and customization options for their characters and personal coffee shops. Real-time features will include synchronized coffee brewing ceremonies, daily coffee challenges that require team coordination, and a global leaderboard showcasing the most dedicated coffee enthusiasts and successful collaborations.

The game will leverage Convex's real-time capabilities to create seamless multiplayer experiences where players can see each other's actions instantly - from stirring coffee to decorating their virtual spaces. Core gameplay will include coffee recipe discovery through collaborative experimentation, where teams of players must work together to unlock rare brewing combinations, timed coffee preparation challenges that require precise coordination, and a unique "coffee mood" system that affects character abilities and unlocks special social interactions. Players can establish and manage their own coffee shop communities, host virtual coffee tastings, and participate in seasonal events like latte art competitions and global coffee appreciation festivals, all rendered with a beautiful, modern UI that makes the coffee culture feel inviting and authentic.
